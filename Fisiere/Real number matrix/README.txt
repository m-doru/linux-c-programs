Program gets 3 files as input.
First 2 files containing the internal representation of (in this order):
  -an integer l representing the number of lines of the matrix
  -an integer c representing the number of columns of the matrix
  -l*c floats representing the elements of the matrix
The third file, at the end of the program, will contain the internal representation of the product or the sum of those 2 matrices if possible, in the same order as the input matrices were given.
